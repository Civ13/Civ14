# Reporting a security vulnerability

You can report a security vulnerability through Discord or through email.

If you want to send an email, you can contact us at <admin@civ13.com>.
If you want to contact us through Discord, you can join [our server](https://discord.gg/hBEtg4x) and then **privately** message any of the staff members.

Some of the security vulnerabilities might not be codebase-specific but rather related to the engine, so you might want to report it to the SS14 team instead/as well: [check here](https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14/blob/master/SECURITY.md)

In either case, **do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until we explicitly give you permission to do so**.
