Valley is a modern map that is WIP. It is a more tactical and RP-based map.

## Factions

### Blugoslavia

Blugoslavian forces have entered the southeastern border region of Greenistan, past the Teelekum mountains, in order to secure their border during the ongoing Greenistani Civil War.

The elements of the 21st Rifle Brigade are present and are equipped with state-of-the-art Blugoslavian armament.

### Greenistani Insurgents

Although there is no current central Greenistani government to oppose them, local warlords have started a campaign of insurgency against the southern occupiers.

The Greenistani insurgency in this area does not have a centralised command. Rather, bands of locals have organised themselves to oppose the Blugoslavian invaders.

They are mostly equipped with obsolete weapons and inferior equipment compared to the Blugoslavians, but their mastery of the mountainous terrain and their hidden underground bases and passages gives them an edge, allowing them to strike behind enemy lines.

### United Nations

The United Nations Greenistan Assistance Force, UNGAFOR, provides civilian releaf and runs a hospital in this area. Although the UN is neutral in this conflict, medical assistance will be rendered to combatants from both sides.

The UN runs a **strict policy of no weapons allowed in UN installations." Attempts by any armed combatants to enter UN controlled areas will be met with deadly force. The UN can and will intervene to protect civilians if need be. UN forces are otherwise a defensive force and will not engage unless fired upon.
