## Gamemodes

Even though all Team Death Match game modes feature two or more teams fighting eachother, there are different victory conditions.

### Symmetric

This could also be called classic, in this game mode each team has to defend their base and capture the opponents'. 

### Asymmetric

Basically siege mode.

### King of the Hill

All teams compete to capture a single objective.

### Points-based

Each team has different conditions they need to meet in order to win.
