# Guide to Metallurgy

Sticks, stones and bones can only carry you so far, but Mother Nature is infinitely generous with her gifts, among which she includes a marvelous class of materials - metals. Grateful and astounded, we accept it and pledge that it will not be wasted on trifles. It shall serve us greatly in mastering ways of cutting, slashing, gutting, chopping and slicing. We shall use it to harness flames and tame explosions, to travel swiftly across vast distances and to bring the Torch of Civilization to the realms of dark ignorance! Bless you, Mother!

Before proceeding to metallurgy, it is recommended to check the [Guide to Crafting](guide_to_crafting.md) for the basics of crafting.

## Obtaining Ores

You will need to mine rocks in order to obtain ores. First, get a pickaxe:

-   You'll need **wood** and **bone** for this. Go gather them (bones are obtained by butchering animals - click the carcass with something sharp, like a flint axe or a knife),
-   Make a **bone pickaxe**.
-   Find a **rock** tile.
-   Wield the axe (press **Z**). Go on **Combat Mode** and click on it while holding the **pickaxe** on your active hand.

## Turning Ores into Metals

### Kiln

The basic ore proccessor is the **kiln**. This will enable you to produce basic ingots: **Gold, Silver, Tin, Copper,** and **Bronze**.

### Bloomery

To produce **Iron**, you will need a **bloomery**.

### Blast Furnace

For advanced alloys like **Steel**, you will need a blast furnace.

## Metals

### Silver

Silver is a rare metal used for currency and jewelry. 1 ingot of silver can be used to produce 100 silver coins. The silver coin (sc) is the the basic measure of value in the game.

### Gold

Gold is the rarest metal, and is used in currency and fancy accessories. Gold has double the rarity and value of silver.

### Tin

Tin is a somewhat rare metal, mostly used to make bronze together with cooper.

### Copper

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Civ13/Civ14/refs/heads/master/Resources/Textures/Objects/Materials/ingots.rsi/copper.png" style="width:64px;height:64px;image-rendering: pixelated;">

Copper is a basic metal that is important early on in the game. You can craft tools, kitchen accessories, and very basic armours from it.

Later in the game, you will need copper to produce electric and electronic products.

### Bronze

Bronze is an alloy of tin and copper. You need to melt 9 parts of copper to 1 part of tin (9:1 ratio) in a **kiln**. For example, 1 unit of tin and 9 units of copper make 10 units of bronze.

Bronze is an important early game alloy that will enable you to make decent weapons and armour.

### Iron

Smelt raw iron ore in the **bloomery** to obtain sponge iron.
Work sponge iron at any anvil into usable iron ingots.

### Steel

Smelt raw iron ore in the **blast furnace** to obtain pig iron.
Work pig iron at the iron or steel anvil into usable steel sheets.
