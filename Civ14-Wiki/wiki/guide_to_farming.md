# Guide to Farming

**WARNING: This guide was originally written for Civ13, and as such might not fully reflect the actual gameplay of Civ14.**

Being a grower of crops is an important role. You farm both food and
cash crops. Growing food is vital for a nation to increase in wealth and
power.

## Tools

To farm, you will require some basic tools.

</td>
<td>A plough is made out of wood and used to plough fields for farming! Used once on the grass and once on the dirt underneath the grass. You can also plough snowy dirt and flooded plains dirt (found along the jungle rivers). In case of snowy grass, you will have to shovel the snow first. Lastly, there are places where you cannot plough: infertile soil, permafrost etc. You can also make an iron plough out of iron ingots to plough land faster.</td>

<td>Made with either 2 bone pieces or a <b><a href="Guide_to_Metallurgy#molds">cast shovel head</a></b>, plus a wooden handle. Used to dig irrigation channels that water crops and do not hinder your movement, unlike flooded trenches. TO dig an irrigation channel, hold a shovel in the active hand and click it, or press Ctrl-Z or Z in the hotkeys mode, then choose the respective option.</td>

## Farming

Just plough a plot of land by yourself or by attaching the plough to a cow or bull for quicker soil disruption, surround said plot of land with trenches with a trench shovel (Cant be walked over easily) or with irrigation channels with a basic shovel (can be walked over easily) filled with fresh water or plough near a river, put some seeds in the ground and watch them grow! Well, it is a bit more nuanced.

### Watering

Plants need water, some more, others less. Weather conditions and
climate also affect the crops in this regard. Each crop has a maximum
water level when planted.

Normally, the water level decreases at the rate of 15 per minute, and
when it reaches zero, the plants wither away. However, in the hot
climates of the Desert and Semi-Arid biomes, water consumption is 25 per
minute. On top of that, in the event of a heatwave, plants will require
more water than usual - additional 10 per minute.

There are a few ways to provide the crops with water:

-   Plough land within two tiles of fresh water, which is any water,
    except for the saltwater. The plants will have all the water they
    need without any extra labor.

-   Dig a flooded trench from the nearest fresh water to irrigate remote
    fields. For this a trench shovel is required, which becomes
    available at the 14 industrial research mark. Dig the first trench
    on a lakeshore or on a riverbank, then the second trench next to the
    first one and so on. Farming fields should be within two tiles of
    the water channel as well. A trench could be removed by filling it with 2 piles of dirt.

-   Dig an irrigation channel from the nearest fresh water, which could be done with any shovel. It functions just like flooded trenches, without the drawback of being a barrier. An irrigation channel could be removed by filling it with 1 pile of dirt.

-   Water the plants manually. Bring the fresh water in buckets and
    barrels and splash it on the ploughed field (the ground, not the plant).

-   Pray for the eternal rain. Rain will water the fields (at the rate
    of 15 per minute), but may create other inconveniences.

### Soil Nutrition

The soil, as in real life, has its level of nutrition. The plants that you plant in the soil will consume its nutrition little by little, until it reaches zero.
If you let the soil rest, without farm plants, it will recover little by little.
At the beginning of each round, every plot of soil will have maximum nutrition.
The maximum soil nutrition is 150.

**To examine the soil, stand close to it and examine it.**
When it is at or above 130:
"The soil looks very alive and the plants will grow very easily."
When it is at or above 80:
"The soil looks alive, plants would grow very well."
When it is above or equal to 25:
"The soil seems half dead and the plants would not develop as well as they should."
When it is greater than 0 and less than 25:
"The soil looks pretty dead and the plants would have a tough time growing."
When it is 0:
"The soil looks dead and plants would hardly grow."

### Impact of soil nutrition on plant growth

Plants have various stages of growth. And to grow from one stage to the next, soil nutrition will be very important.
When soil nutrition is,

-   above 80: Guaranteed growth.
-   greater than or equal to 40: Growth probability equal to soil fertility.
-   greater than 0 and less than 40: 40% growth probability.
-   equal to zero: 20% chance of growth.

### Soil recovery

You can let a plot of land rest, with no farm plants on it, and it will recover every 20 minutes.
After the time has passed, the soil will receive 20 to 40 nutrition points automatically.
Considering a soil with 0 nutrition, it would take from 2.5 to 1.25 hours for it to fully regenerate.

### Fertilizing

Many kinds of animals leave manure on the ground, which could be used to
fertilize a field. This is one way to restore nutrition to your soil.
You can use manure, fertilizer, or dung to nourish it.
By fertilizing the soil, you will automatically fertilize all the soil in 3x3, around the soil that you have fertilized.

Manure: 10 points of nutrition,
Dung: 20 nutrition points,
Fertilizer: 60 nutrition points.

The **compost bin** (10 wood, "economy and production" section) also turns food scraps, plant matter (seeds, some plants) and something unpleasant else into fertilizer. Just place it in the bin and wait for a while. Fertilizer could also be used to refuel ovens etc.

When the soil health is above 80 points, out of a maximum of 150, you can harvest up to two extra products, out of the normal harvest product.

### Severe weather

Be aware that blizzards will freeze the plants and kill them. A
heatwave, as noted in the Watering section, will cause the crops to
consume more water than usual. Sandstorms will also destroy the plants.
You can try to cover them during the winter with tents, however, be sure
to remove them in spring or they won't keep growing!

### Biomes and seasons

Different biomes have different plants that could be cultivated in them.
Take notice, that some plants grow only in certain seasons. Biome
restriction applies only to the largest maps: Continents, Pangea, Europe and New
World.

Wet (winter and spring) and dry (summer and fall) seasons apply to the
Desert, Savanna and Jungles biomes.
