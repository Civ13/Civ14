# Nomads

**Tip: If this is your first time playing, you should probably also check the [starter guide](starter_guide.md).**

## What is the Nomads mode?

In Nomads, everyone spawns without any predetermined roles or factions. The map is a complete wilderness, ready to be explored and settled. There are no prebuilt structures, except for occasional ancient ruins.

You can stay factionless (a nomad), create your own faction or join an existing one. There is no predetermined goal.

A map may have one or more ethnicities, each speaking its own language initially incomprehensible to a speaker of a different language. On certain maps you can choose who you spawn as, while on other maps it is random.

What will each civilization desire? Military power? World domination? Scholars with advanced technology? Mass resource output and production? Commerce and trade? Raiding? Itâ€™s up to you or your leaders to decide!

## Becoming Civilized

Perhaps you have noticed that your ability to craft things is a bit limited in comparison to other people, and you would like to make more. ~~Only members of a faction can research new technologies and accumulate research points.~~ (Not implemented yet in Civ14).

Perhaps you are finding surviving alone difficult. Perhaps you enjoy the company and roleplay opportunity that comes with engaging with other players. If those apply to you, then you should consider joining or starting a faction.

The benefits of joining or assembling a faction:

-   ~~Gain access to that factions research levels, which equates to more things you can craft~~ (Not implemented yet in Civ14).

-   More opportunity to roleplay in a manner you want to. From becoming a towns blacksmith, simple farmer, village idiot, to village chieftain, diplomat, emperor, or anything you want to try and make happen.

-   Depending on the faction, you might have access to shared resources and facilities.

-   Safety in numbers. Raiders will think twice before attacking a city, whereas a loner is an easy target for burglars, thieves, pillagers, and robbers.

### Factions

Factions are basically "teams". Everyone in the same faction shares the same research points, and everyone in the faction contributes to everyone else when they perform research.

But that also means that lazy people can take advantage of your technology and resources and not contribute a thing...

A small tight-knit group of workers that contribute is often better off than a large group of slackers that just consume.

Pick your members wisely\! Or cunningly use them to your advantage...

Work smart, not hard!

## Research

Not implemented yet in Civ14. The only mode of scientific progression at the moment is the "Auto-Research" mode, where the research levels and ages progress automatically after a certain time.

## Environments

The environment lives and breathes and will be the single biggest factor that influences your life!

Each map has either a single biome or several different ones.

There are seasons of the year, effects of which are different in every biome. Some biomes have four seasons, while others have only two.

On large maps with multiple biomes each biome has its own list of plants that could be grown there. Many plants also grow only in certain seasons. See the **[Guide to Farming](guide_to_farming.md)**.

To determine the biome you are in, read the descriptions below and look at your surroundings. Looking at the map of **[Pangea](https://civ13.github.io/civ13-wiki/assets/images/map_pangea.png)** that has almost every biome may also help. From top to bottom: Tundra, Taiga (roughly the southern half of the snowed area, before the northern mountains), Temperate, Semi-Arid, Desert, Savanna, Jungle. The only biome missing is Sea.

### Biomes and seasons

#### Tundra

-   Snow covers the ground all year round and does not melt during summer (unlike in Temperate).

-   Trees and animals are somewhat rare here.

Seasons:

-   Summer: Amene temperatures, some snow melts, revealing dirt, and crops can grow. No chance of snowfall or blizzard. Wild animals respawn.

-   Winter: Icy temperatures requiring coat, high chance of snowfall, chance of deadly blizzard. Crops stop growing, snow covers all land. Have a shelter ready or you probably won't survive until summer.

#### Taiga

Similar to Tundra in many regards, but considerably more trees.

#### Temperate

Plenty of trees and grassy meadows ("wild grass" tiles).

Seasons:

-   Spring: Amene temperatures, a little leftover snow from the winter. Sparse rains cause mud slowdowns. Snow starts melting.

-   Summer: Hot temperatures, no rain. Chance of heat-waves that evaporate all puddles. All snow melts. Wild animals respawn at a faster rate.

-   Fall: Cooler temperatures, sparse rain and occasional snowfall will slow you down.

-   Winter: Icy temperatures can kill you without a fur coat, some lakes and rivers freeze over, allowing you to walk on them. Constant snowfall slows you down, **crops will not grow and animals won't respawn**. Chance of blizzards that cause a whiteout, and can kill you even with fur coats. Have a shelter ready\!

#### Sea

Smaller islands on larger maps usually have this biome. This is similar to the Temperate biome but without snow or cold winters.

#### Semi-Arid

Large expanses of dry dirt with occasional groves. A transition biome between Temperate and Desert. No snow during the winter.

#### Desert

Sand. Lots of sand.

Seasons:

-   Dry Season: All the water sources dry up, has a chance of sandstorms, which impair vision, but cause no other ill-effects. Heat is intense and can harm you if you stay in the sun too long.

-   Wet Season: All water sources fill up, sandstorms die down. Wild animals respawn.

#### Savanna

Wide plains covered with sunburnt dry grass. Acacia trees are a common sight here. A drier version of the Jungle biome.

#### Jungle

Lush vegetation with massive jungle trees and large bushes; thick jungle grass covers the ground.

Seasons:

-   Dry Season: Fertile floodplains on the riverbanks are uncovered, sunny weather most of the time.

-   Wet Season: Heavy rains and the arable land along the rivers is flooded.

## Nomads maps

Civ14 currently generates a random when a round starts. You will have to discover the map yourself!
