  # Core Rule 6 - Use Mainly English
  You must be fluent in English enough to be able to not cause game issues, and to be able to communicate with game admins when necessary. You can use other languages in OOC and ingame IF the people you are talking to speak the language. If a game admin does not feel that you are fluent enough in English, they may kick you.

  ## Why
  We do not have enough staff fluent in other languages to moderate them. Translation tools can be unreliable and are not integrated well into the game.

  ## Non-English Options
  There are many servers that allow or focus on other languages. You are highly encouraged to play only on servers that allow languages you are fluent in.
