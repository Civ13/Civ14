  ## Roleplay Rules
  These rules only apply during a round. A round ends only when the round summary has appeared. All of these rules apply fully until the moment that the round summary appears, even while the arrivals shuttle is in transit.

  The deathmatch and sandbox game modes are exempt from these rules. Players who choose to not follow these rules are entirely responsible for knowing if an exempt game mode is active.

  Roleplay rules do not apply to ghosts/spectators/observers while they are ghosts/spectators/observers. Dead chat is considered to be an in-game out of character chat channel.
