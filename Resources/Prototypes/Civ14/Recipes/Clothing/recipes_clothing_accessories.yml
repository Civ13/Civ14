  description: >-
    This oval shaped, argentium sterling silver locket hangs on an incredibly
    fine, refractive string, almost thin as hair and microweaved from links to a
    deceptive strength, of similar material. The edges are engraved very
    delicately with an elegant curving design, but overall the main is unmarked
    and smooth to the touch, leaving room for either remaining as a stolid piece
    or future alterations. There is an obvious internal place for a picture or
    lock of some sort, but even behind that is a very thin compartment unhinged
    with the pinch of a thumb and forefinger.
